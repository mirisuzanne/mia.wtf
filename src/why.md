title: Notes towards a queer art
sub: and a queer web, world wide
summary:
  People are ==queer==.
  People are edge cases.
  ==We fall== between meanings,
  and explore outside them.
  That, to me, is ==beautiful.==
---

We string together ==our best== recollections
and call them a matter of time.
_First this, then that._
But every story is incomplete --
full of holes and ==misdirection.==

So that is what ==I like==.
Bits borrowed from here and there.
Accidents triggering unexpected associations.
Grasping at ==stability and form==,
but always coming up short.

I seek out
software that respects our autonomy;
==collaborations that reflect== back our diversity;
and art that gives us a venue to consider
the <black-out>non-sense</black-out>
that remains â€”
what ==manifestos== can never say.
Because understanding is not
a pre-requisite ==for humanity.==
