Practicing a more queer and humane future, together.
Performance is an embodied process
for imagining, exploring,
and _deepening our humanity_.

<!-- intro -->

[Julie Rada](https://www.julierada.com/about)
and I met in late 2007,
working together at [Countdown To Zero](https://countdowntozero.org/)
and [The LIDA Project](http://lida.org/)
before quickly starting to produce our own work
as [Grapefruit Lab](https://grapefruitlab.com/)
(n√©e _Vicious Trap_).

In addition to creating our own original
hybrid-media performances,
we also facilitate
[ACT Ensemble](https://grapefruitlab.com/prisonarts/),
exploring art and performance
with artists in Colorado prisons.
