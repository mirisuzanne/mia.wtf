CSS is the design language of the web,
with a focus on total surfer
control and customization.
From your browser preferences,
you can re-design any website!

<!-- intro -->

As an editor on several CSS specification modules:

- [Cascading & Inheritance](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade/),
  levels 5+
- [Conditional Rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-conditional-5/),
  level 5
- [Values & Units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-5/),
  level 5
- [Functions & Mixins](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-mixins/),
  level 1 (Editor's Draft)

I've had a lead role in defining
popular features like
cascade layers, container queries, scope,
mixins, functions, and (recently) value-mixing.

You can

or even help out
by [sponsoring my work](https://opencollective.com/oddbird-open-source)
on features that matter to you.
