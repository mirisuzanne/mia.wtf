description: Art & code & other digital artifacts of my life.
summary:
  - >
    **I'm [Miriam](/about/)**,
    a hybrid artist
    in Denver, CO --
    often making [music](/music/)
    & [theater](/theater/)
    & [web stuff](/web/).
    These days, I'm also into
    _yarn_ and _pottery_
    and _mechanical clocks_.
  - >
    _People are queer_.
    We fall between meanings,
    and explore outside them.
    We [grasp at stability and form](/why/),
    but always come up short.
  - >
    I was told that
    _every home page should be selling something_.
    But
    [all this capitalism](https://business-business.business/)
    just makes me feel tired.
