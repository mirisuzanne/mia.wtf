summary:
  - >
    **I'm [Miriam](/about/)**,
    a hybrid artist --
    often creating [music](/music/)
    & [theater](/theater/)
    & [websites](/web/),
    or [teaching](/web/teaching/)
    and [developing new features](/orgs/csswg/)
    for the <abbr>CSS</abbr> language.
    These days, I'm also into
    _yarn_ and _pottery_
    and _mechanical clocks_.
  - >
    _People are queer_.
    We fall between meanings,
    and explore outside them.
    We [grasp at stability and form](/why/),
    but always come up short.
  - >
    I was told that
    _every home page should be selling something_.
    But I don't want
    to be [a business](https://business-business.business/).
