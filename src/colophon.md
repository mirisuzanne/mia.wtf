sub: as much for me as it is for you
summary:
  This site uses the
  [remix icon](https://remixicon.com) set --
  which is free,
  and doesn't require any attribution.
  That sentence was entirely unnecessary.
  But I have to write it down here,
  so that I remember it later.

I also used:

- HTML & CSS with some JS
- Custom elements, some of them externalâ€¦
  - `toggle-control`, `switch-control`, and `input-control`
    for various UI controls (especially the theme dialog)
  - `eight-ball` for randomized content
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator
- [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) template language
- Occasional [microformats](https://microformats.org)
- [Alegreya](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-ht-pro)
  variable,
  [Alegreya Sans](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht),
  & [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) variable
  fonts (by way of [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/))
