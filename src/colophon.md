title: What's in a website?
sub: the nerds call this a [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing))
summary:
  This site uses the
  [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com) set --
  which is free,
  and doesn't require any attribution.
  That sentence was entirely discretionary.
  Literally _uncalled for_.
  But I have to write it down somewhere,
  so that I remember it later.

I also used more than my share of HTML & CSS,
with some JS thrown in for good luck.
There are CSS features that I invented,
and then used on this site!

I also developed a number of custom elements, which was fun.

Here are some things that other people built
(and I used (with permission)):

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/),
  with several official plugins
- [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) template language
- [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com)
- [Alegreya](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-ht-pro)
  variable,
  [Alegreya Sans](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht),
  & [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) variable
  fonts (by way of [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/))
