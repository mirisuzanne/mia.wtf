I made this small corner of _The Web_,
using text files full of
instructions for computers,
aka _code_.

<!-- intro -->

I especially like making web art:

- [Men In Brackets](https://men.mia.wtf/)
  -- _What men daily do, in brackets_
- [NSA 4 Us](https://nsa4.us/)
  -- _if you think something, say something_
- [Monkey Writer](https://monkey.writr.art/)
  -- _for finite monkeys on a deadline_
- [The Post-Obsolete Book](https://post-obsolete.com/)
  -- _a memorial for obsolescence_
- [Bu\$ine$$-Bu\$ine$$ Dot Bu\$ine$$](https://business-business.business/)
  -- _money gain profit_
- [Riding SideSaddle](https://ridingsidesaddle.com/)
  -- _a novel on note cards and also online_
