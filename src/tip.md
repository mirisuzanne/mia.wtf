I enjoy contributing to the web community
through teaching, open source tools,
the front-end.social mastodon server,
or developing new CSS features.
If you appreciate what I do,
please consider
[supporting my work](https://opencollective.com/oddbird-open-source).

If you or your company
are interested in sponsoring my participation
in the W3C CSS Working Group,
please [reach out](/contact/).

I lead the design process for several popular language features,
including _cascade layers_,
_container queries_ (for size, style, state, and related units),
_scoped styles_,
and the _progress_ data type.
My current focus is on _custom functions & mixins_,
and I would love to make progress on
_logical property shorthands_.
