Sommer asked people to record themselves reading a poem
from her collection, *Backup Singers*.
I put together this video
of the poem *Alcohol affects the frontal cortex*.

> I put out a call on social media
> asking for people to record themselves
> reading a poem from my poetry collection *Backup Singers*
> in order to create a crowdsourced version of the book.
> What resulted is a kind of double-sided diary
> told by my friends, family, peers, and total strangers.
> They are my words but read in other peoplesâ€™ bedrooms,
> on their porches, on their commutes, with their children.
> Two kinds of intimacies are joined
> and rather than them canceling each other out
> they are somehow multiplied.
