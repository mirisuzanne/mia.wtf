      the moving walkway is ending.
      Lego mini-figure in a bee outfit on a moving walkway
      framed against blue sky and lens flare off blinds,

      please watch you're step.
      The blinds are more prominent, radial,
      over a mini-figure with a helmet and axe,
      light exposure is blown out,
      and a series of winding symbols over top --
      flag, frown, hand pointing left, hand making peace sign

      Exit stage right. Strata (layers)!
      The image now seems aged, sepia,
      and drawn over in black ink.

      Computer drawn scribbles
      and aligned white arrows
      over top the black pen

      The image is duplicated,
      offset,
      overlaid with an old map of the world

      The judge ordered the merchant to cease and desist
      from the deceptive…
      The image has been printed out,
      crumpled, and photographed
      casting shadows on a white background.
      Again the four symbols are overlaid,
      and now red arrows go to (or radiate from)
      the left-pointing hand

      The previous image is constrained to a digital thought bubble
      emanating from five green plastic toy soldiers,
      now all aimed at the Lego figure in a bee outfit.
      Random drop shadows are scattered on the page,
      and a quote:
      I'm right here, where Lee Harvey Oswald
      shot Abraham Lincoln, and ghosts of snow gust
      across the empty road.

      A movie poster.
      Exit Strata, in the movie poster font.
      Blood is splattered across a topped plastic soldier,
      a Lego axe on the ground,
      and hand-drawn Lego Lincoln super-imposed.
  - img: tennis/volley9.jpg
    alt: >
      The poster is framed,
      and imposed on a back and white return
      of the old map.
  - img: tennis/volley10.jpg
    alt: >
      The map is ripped in half across the page,
      revealing red-line-drawn Lego Lincoln
      on a white background -
      and half the text exit strata

[Layer tennis](http://layertennis.com/)
is a design game
made popular by
[Coudal Partners](https://www.coudal.com/).
Two competitors (myself & [Aaron Liechty](https://aaronliechty.tumblr.com/))
pass design files back and forth,
riffing on the same work under extreme time constraints.
Each 30-minute "volley" is posted live as it is created,
along with commentary
thanks to [Jacob Liechty](https://jacobliechty.tumblr.com/).

[Sondra Eisenstat](https://sondraeby.com/)
agreed to help us
with the thankless task of posting it all online,
since the rest of us were pre-occupied
with writing & designing under pressure.

The battle took place on Sunday afternoon.
The full experience is still available
on the [Exit Strata blog][blog],
but here are the volleys:
