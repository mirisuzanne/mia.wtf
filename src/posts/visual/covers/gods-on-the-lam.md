    Gods on the Lam book cover spread
    in bold yellow and rusty red,
    with a messy collage of pulp fiction characters -
    a black woman singer,
    a white male scientist,
    and some white cowboys flailing their pistols

<!-- intro -->

[Christopher David Rosales](https://www.christopherrosales.com/)
and
[Perpetual Motion Machine](https://perpetualpublishing.com/product/gods-on-the-lam/)
commissioned me
to provide custom artwork
for the cover of this great new book.
They were particularly drawn
to imagery and style
from my [Screwtooth](/2014/08/02/screwtooth/)
instsallation.
