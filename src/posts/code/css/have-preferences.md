You're allowed to have preferences.
That's what the web is designed for.
Set your preferences.

<!-- intro -->

I've been playing with user styles.

Not like fancy site-specific styles,
just setting the defaults that I want.
Slightly larger text,
nicer fallback fonts, etc. Why not?

- **Firefox**/Gecko:
  `about:preferences` (GUI)
- **Chrome**/Blink:
  `chrome://settings/appearance` (GUI)
- **Safari**/WebKit: go to…
  `Settings / Advanced / Style sheet…`
  (you'll need to write CSS)

As a developer
I worry about seeing
something different
than what other people will see
by default.
But then I think:
that's the whole point, right?
We should be mindful of that anyway.

What do you want the default web to look like?
