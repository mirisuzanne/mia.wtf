I'm a sucker for a good
personal site redesign,
especially when it comes with
an attached blog post.

<!-- intro -->

I especially like that the post
shows how the old design looked.

Both the before and after pics
show inspiring, fun designs.
Both designs represent Melanie's interests
in beautiful visual clues --
from computers to quilting.
It makes the designs feel personal.
