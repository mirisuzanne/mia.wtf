Jordan and I were never close.
Her colleagues say she was private,
but I only experienced her generosity,
kindness, and humor.
She was one of the first trans women I talked to
before coming out.

<!-- intro -->

She was blunt about her own experience,
but endlessly supportive.
*You do you, girl. You have to do you.*
After that, she checked in regularly —
making sure I was ok.

I know I wasn't the only trans woman she helped.
Jordan saved lives.

I only saw her perform once,
and it was amazing.
She's also a great [writer][writer].
I recommend a trip down the [rabbit hole][hole].
Is that gross?
It sounds gross.
