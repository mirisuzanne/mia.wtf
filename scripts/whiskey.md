## Part 1: The Myth

_[In the center of the stage is a kiddie pool with water in it. Dan and Sondra are in two of the corners, stage right, with their equipment. Miriam is downstage left, with a bass/amp and an overhead projector pointed at a screen upstage left. Throughout, Miriam is projecting slides ‘related’ to the material. Pictures of lakes, landmarks, etc. The slides can be stylized, rather than accurate or correct – they can get weird, and associative.]_

### [Song] Whiskey 1

_[The music starts on guitar. Maybe there are projections starting here?]_

Herman starts running always at night when there's less texture and the shapes become clear — skirting the pools of light around gas stations. In the foothills he finds a spring, and dives in for a midnight swim.

Sam was not one to bend the bow, or join the hunt, or go paint-balling with the older girls. Day after day she would bathe alone in her favorite spring, or lay amongst the reeds and smoke a bowl.

### [Story] The cursed spring

_[Over the course of the show, as they have time, the band are blowing up floaty apparel, and eventually putting them on.]_

**Mia:** Have you heard that story? Old Denver lore. People say myth, but we were there. Not like there there in the spring when they joined, but we knew Herman – and we got to know Sam then too, of course. Maybe you haven’t heard their names, but most people know about the spring, right? “In the foothills” the song says, but honestly, I’ve heard a lot of conflicting stories about the spring.

**Sondra:** Same. People say it’s cursed.

**Dan:** ooooooh.

**Mia:** Yes. The curs-ed spring.

**Sondra:** ooooooh.

**Mia:** _[Miriam has a presentation to give]_ I wonder if it’s been built over. You know, some new apartment building – the kind that pop up everywhere in town – my neighborhood is covered in them. Used to be Baker, but now (get this) people are calling it SoBo?

**Sondra:** SoBo?

**Mia:** I used to have a view of the mountains and the french fry sculpture – the one near the highway, you know? I used to have a Kmart across the street, where I could buy socks and underwear. Remember k-mart? Now I just have more and more apartment buildings.

**Dan:** People HAVE to live SOMEwhere.

**Mia:** But people also need to buy underwear! Big Lots is a bar now, and so is Kitty’s South.

**Dan:** People have to drink somewhere.

**Mia:** I’m not suggesting those specific buildings have covered the spring. No one’s claiming that the spring was in Baker. Or SoBo. Most people just say west. Maybe Arvada?

**Dan:** Lakewood?

**Sondra:** Wheat Ridge?

**Mia:** Could be Golden even? There’s a guy online who claims it’s the waterfall in Casa Bonita, but I think he just says that to get a laugh. Do you say Casa Bonita, or Casa Bonita?

**Sondra:** Casa.

**Dan:** Casa. GalaPAYgo. Teejun.

**Mia:** Anyway, I think it’s like: they couldn’t make good food, but at least they have a mystical pool of water! I guess their food is supposed to be better now? Since the renovations and everything? I haven’t been yet. Have you?

**Dan/Sondra:** No.

**Mia:** There’s something always magical about water. It’s mysterious, right? What’s in there? And then a cursed pool? It’s like holy water. The whole idea is so appealing. Maybe because we’re mostly water?

**Sondra:** We’re really only about 60% water on average.

**Dan:** That’s STILL mostly.

**Sondra:** Yeah, but humans are a lot of things. Saying we’re water just sounds nice when you say it.

**Mia:** All our atoms used to be star dust.

**Dan:** And more recently, dinosaur shit, (what's your point)?

**Mia:** Do you think the water stays in us, or it’s mostly just passing through?

**Sondra:** All my atoms have gone through the water cycle, do you have a slide for that? _[Miriam does]_ Yeah – evaporating, condensing into clouds, and then raining.

**Dan:** Drink the water, be the water, pee the water. Repeat.

_[They all stare at the pool]_

**Mia:** But not in… _[points to the pool]_

**Dan:** Right.

**Sondra:** Gross. _[distracted]_ Why’s there a kiddie pool?

**Mia:** I don’t know. It was here when we arrived.

**Sondra:** Oh. Yeah, ok.

**Dan:** Should we worry about power cables or anything?

**Mia:** I… Don’t know… Just work around it, I guess?

[Silence. No one knows. The pool is mystical.]

**Sondra:** Do you ever think about past lives? Who you were before?

**Dan:** Back when I was 60% different 60% water?

**Mia:** I used to live in Indiana.

**Sondra:** That’s not really what I meant.

**Mia:** You mean like Herman, before Sam? Alone? _[Thinks…]_ I’ve always been just me, I guess.

**Sondra:** Well, yeah. But we were different back then, right?

**Dan:** I used to be smart.

**Mia:** Oh! I used to wear glasses, for one year in grade school.

**Sondra:** I used to be an evangelical.

**Dan:** I used to live in New York, never been to the city.

**Mia:** I used to live on a farm.

**Dan/Sondra:** Oh yeah/me too.

**Sondra:** I used to play piano, and sing in a choir.

**Mia:** Oh right, I played violin and clarinet.

**Sondra:** I always wanted to sing in a choir. It was a dream I acquired (haha) at age 8. I toured the midwest with a choir at 12, and Europe at 17. At 18 I was one of only two from my high school that made the cut for the VA State Senior Honors Choir.

**Mia:** Ooh, fancy. I had no idea!

**Dan:** (and then) What happened?

**Sondra:** In college I failed to make the cut for the exclusive Bel Canto Singers. The director said I was a disgrace to my family.

**Mia:** Fuuuuuck.

**Dan:** That’s dumb.

**Mia:** No one said that to me, but I guess I also stopped singing at some point.

**Sondra:** Oh, also I’m a mom now! I used to not be a mom.

**Dan:** Oh, me too! I mean, not a mom, but I do get called mom all the time… or queen daddy. I like that one!

**Mia:** That’s fun! I used to be a boy, I guess. I don’t know, it’s confusing.

**Dan:** I used to be a boy. I mean, I still am, but I also used to be.

**Mia:** That’s also confusing.

**Dan:** (yup) _[nods]_

**Sondra:** I used to have a name for my gender.

**Mia:** I wanted to be a gymnast, but I was self conscious when my dad came to watch, and then he said I wasn’t good enough, and it was a waste of money, and he pulled me out of the class.

**Sondra:** Jeez.

**Dan:** I used to be lonely, and live in a basement.

**Sondra:** I used to be straight, now I’m bi. _[pause]_ Oooooh, is this my coming out show?

**Mia:** I used to be straight! We should start a club for ex-straights!

**Dan:** I used to mow lawns, and clean houses… I mean, with a bunch of straight people.

**Mia:** I used to live off the grid, with solar power. And now I live by a car wash in SoBo.

### [Song] ?Carousel?

### [Story] Moving West

**Mia:** Oh I should introduce us. Sorry. _[A picture of Sondra]_ That’s Sondra on drums. I mean, you can see she’s on drums. I’m just used to saying that when we play shows. “That’s Sondra on Drums.”

**Dan:** This is a show, right? You’re allowed to say it.

**Mia:** _[A picture of Dan]_ And that’s Dan on guitar. _[More pictures]_ Dan plays all the instruments if you let him. _[Band picture]_ We met in college. Small town, Indiana. Wild, right? That’s where we met Herman, too. We could drive up to the Indiana dunes, on Lake Michigan. Or Applebees, or whatever.

**Dan:** You didn’t introduce yourself.

**Mia:** Oh right, sorry. I’m Miriam. But I had a different name in college. Maybe I was a different person?

**Sondra:** You were more… something. You used to live with us. Remember that?

**Mia:** Yeah, several times. But first I lived… beside you? The same house, but separate.

**Sondra:** We had our own entrance.

**Dan:** And our own exit.

**Mia:** And each man in his time plays many parts…?

**Dan:** What?

**Mia:** Sorry, I thought you were doing a Shakespeare thing. I have theater brain, it ruins everything.

**Sondra:** I like going to theater, usually.

**Dan:** I like theater music. But not musical theater.

**Sondra:** Yeah, I’m glad we’re not doing that.

**Mia:** I like theater in theory, I guess. But then… It’s like opera, right? It’s such a cool idea. All the arts at once – dance, poetry, music, lights – what more could you want? Ges…amt…kunst…werk – that’s German. Total artwork! Immersive! Meow Wolf!

**Sondra:** Casa Bonita!

**Mia:** Yeah! But then, in reality… Eh. Take it or leave it. I guess, back then, I kinda left it. Stopped making theater. That’s when we started hanging out. I wasn’t used to having evenings free. I didn’t know what to do.

**Sondra:** Start a band, that’s what.

**Mia:** Oh yeah, that was when we started?

**Dan:** We had a different name then. A different animal.

**Sondra:** And a lead singer.

**Dan:** Now we just follow.

**Mia:** Yeah, that was the band before the band before this one. With Herman on vocals, back in Indiana, before we all moved. You can change who plays bass, and it’s still the same band. But when you change singers, that’s hard.

**Dan:** You stop being Grateful, and now you're just The Dead.

**Mia:** And then Herman decided to move west. It took me by surprise. I think all of us.

**Sondra:** Dan and I had just bought a house in Indiana, and the band is moving to Denver? Real cool, Herman.

**Mia:** I think Herman was growing restless. And so was I. A small town, where everyone knows us – knows our parents, our back story, every mistake we’ve made. It’s too much.

**Dan:** No one knew my parents.

**Sondra:** Or mine.

**Mia:** Ok, just Herman and I, we grew up there. So everyone has a story in their head about who we are. And those stories gain this, like, narrative inertia, right? Stories in motion, stay in motion, or something? That’s physics.

**Dan:** Wait, what.

**Sondra:** I don’t think that’s physics.

**Dan:** Figurative Newtons?

**Mia:** But when Herman says I’m moving to Denver, do you want to come with me? I’ve only been to Denver once, as a kid – but it’s a city, and I wasn’t expecting it. Here’s my chance, a plot twist! Spoiler alert! No one will see this coming!

**Sondra:** Not even your band mates.

**Mia:** And there are mountains in Denver – sunlight most of the year? A music scene. That sounds pretty good. It’s the opposite of a small town in Indiana.

**Sondra:** Aren’t they both considered midwest?

**Dan:** At least people call Denver midwest sometimes.

**Mia:** No. We moved from the midwest. It was different there, wasn’t it?

**Sondra:** But California is the west west, right? Oregon, Washington, all that. And they’re way farther west. It can’t all just be one big west for almost half the country?

**Mia:** Sure, but the midwest is basically still east.

**Sondra:** What’s between west and midwest?

**Dan:** Colorado Mills?

**Mia:** Mountain west?

**Sondra:** To the west coast, we’re all just flyover country.

**Dan:** Unless you fly Southwest.

**Mia:** Anyway, I like mountains. I don’t love the outdoors – hiking biking climbing like every Denver dating profile. But I like looking at mountains, and being close to them. That’s good enough for me. So I told Herman, sure, let’s get out of here. And at the time, we didn’t know what that meant for the band. We didn’t know if Dan and Sondra would want to come with us or not.

**Sondra:** That’s rude though, right? Moving away, just when your friends bought a house?

**Dan:** Herman even encouraged us to buy it!

**Mia:** I don’t know, probably. But you made it out here eventually. I just knew it was time to be somewhere else.

**Sondra:** You wanted new friends.

**Mia:** That’s not–

**Sondra:** Don’t lie. You wanted Shiny new Denver friends. We were musty old Indiana friends.

**Mia:** I wanted things to be different. I wanted more… queerness? Change is, I don’t know…

**Sondra:** Violent?

**Mia:** Maybe, sometimes. Like there’s a violence in hanging on, but also a violence in letting go?

**Sondra:** Love is like a magic penny…?

**Mia/Dan:** What?

**Sondra:** Hold it tight and you won't have any / Lend it, spend it, and you'll have so many / They'll roll all over the floor.

**Mia:** I’m glad you came along, and I’m glad you’re still here.

### [Song] ?Ascending?

### [Story] Describing Herman

**Mia:** I feel like we should tell you more about Herman. It’s weird knowing the people at the center of a myth. Or urban legend, or whatever. But yeah, what do you want to know? I guess Herman… Herman is… tall?

**Sondra:** Not that tall, not like towering.

**Mia:** Sure but taller than me, and sometimes people will say: you’re kinda tall, can you reach that… whatever… on the top shelf? Which, sometimes I can. But Herman can almost always reach whatever.

**Dan:** Maybe Herman just seemed taller, like, after.

**Sondra:** I used to have the biggest feet in my class, but now my feet are just average.

**Mia:** My feet got smaller on hormones. I lost two sizes! No one tells you that.

**Dan:** Aaaand the frogs are gay now.

**Sondra:** The what?!

**Dan:** The government is turning frogs gay! Or something. Something about the government, and estrogen in the drinking water, and frogs turning gay.

**Mia:** Oh yeah, Alex Jones wants to sell you more water filters!

**Sondra:** Is that a myth or a conspiracy theory?

**Mia:** Or a grift?

**Dan:** Why not all three?

**Sondra:** Gay frogs sound fabulous. Are they also merging into one frog body, with two frog genders? Can we follow the frogs to find the spring?

## Part 2: Bodies of Water

### [Song] Whiskey 2

oh i in the garden i wander and every tree i passed was russet red leafed, glowing like blood

Sam follows him along the path to his favorite spring where he undresses slowly, distracted by the touch of field grass against bare thighs. Mating dragonflies hover-buzz low over the water - their wings hit ripples in every direction as Herman stands naked, adjusting himself with a thoughtless touch.

When Herman squints, the clouds become a lion or a ship with sails that dip and become claws. Looking down he sees Sam reflected in the water.

oh i in the garden i wander and every tree i passed was russet red leafed, glowing like blood

They sink below the surface, Sam's legs wrapped tight around his torso choking air from his lungs. Herman bites her neck and struggles, to no avail A trickle of blood air escapes his open mouth she's laughing, gropes his bare chest, strokes his hair, eyes soft. The clear lake turns to mud with their kicking.

Sam gasps for air and finds herself alone. Herman gasps for air and finds herself alone. They wipe the mud from their body.

oh i in the garden i wander and every tree i passed was russet red leafed, glowing like blood

_[instrumental]_

It's hard to say exactly what happens first.

Sam has a fever, and Herman sits with her through the night, and by morning they become one — her bust, but him from the waist down. And they continue to use both names, but it takes some time to get the coordination down — he'll sit while she stands or the other way around. Eventually they figure it out, and we all get used to it, and it's nice because you can sit alone with one, but if you'd rather have the other beside you… there she is.

### [Story] Pollution, maybe

**Mia:** We don’t know how these things happen – people merging together in water.

**Sondra:** The Gods?

**Dan:** Pollution?

**Mia:** In some of the stories, it’s really violent. Sam is… problematic? I mean, she knows what she wants, can you blame her? This nymph sees a naked hottie, and just like… latches on. She won’t let go! And the gods (or whatever) make it permanent. They’re stuck like that, half-and-half.

**Sondra:** When you say it like that…

**Mia:** Is that what she wanted, or are the gods playing with them? I don’t know. But there’s something so pure about that lust! The need to be inseparable! And they loved each other, loved sharing that body. At least eventually… But at the time? Did anyone ask what Herman wants? Just a peaceful midnight swim? he’s out skinny dipping, and suddenly he’s half-nymph?

**Dan:** And then Herman curses the spring, right? Like, fuck you, spring.

**Mia:** That’s one story, yeah. Or he cries out, and so the gods do that, too. Now the water makes men soft. And maybe also frogs? Citation needed. No one really cares about the frogs anyway, except right-wing weirdos – but it’s considered a Very Bad Thing for men to become half woman. That’s the curse.

**Sondra:** Not a curse for everyone.

**Dan:** But illegal in Texas.

**Mia:** And we’ve looked for this spring or pond or –

**Dan:** One time I heard it was a ‘well’ – like a wishing well, but it sounds a little too on-the-nose to be true.

**Sondra:** Could it be a kiddie pool? _[They all look]_ I mean, it’s a stretch to call it a spring or pond or well…

**Dan:** In the oral tradition, though? Meaning can shift.

**Sondra:** Or translation / from the Greek.

**Dan:** / from Latin.

**Mia:** I’ve dipped my feet in all the bodies of water in this desert state. Well, obviously, not all – not this one, I guess – but I’m working through them. I figure places like Wash Park and Sloan’s Lake and City Park aren’t it because plenty of people dip their hands and toes in – fishing with kids or lazily paddle-boating. But I’ve tried them, just in case.

**Sondra:** You have?

**Mia:** Yeah, if it’s a body of water, I give it a shot. One time I was on the train around Lakeside and it broke down – stopped about ¾ of the way around the lake. Someone from Lakeside walked us back to the main park, under the scaffolding of the Wild Chipmunk. They gave us free ride tickets as an apology. But, when we got off the train, I trailed behind a little to dip my fingers in the water. Nothing. I felt nothing. But the smell of the diesel engine made me a bit queasy.

**Dan:** Didn’t you try to get a job at Lakeside once?

**Mia:** Yeah, when we first moved here. I lived in that basement by Berkeley Lake. And then there’s Sheridan, and Lakeside – which is Lake Rhoda. Did you know it has a name? It’s not just the lake that lakeside is beside, it’s Lake Rhoda. I didn’t know what to do for work, so I applied.

**Sondra:** And? What happened?

**Mia:** I don’t know. I guess I never heard back?

**Dan:** So, did you ask Herman?

**Mia:** About Lakeside?

**Dan:** No, about the spring.

**Mia:** Oh yeah. She just changed the subject, so… _[shrugs]_ That was after Sam… I don’t know. Herman didn’t want to talk about it. And at a certain point, she didn’t want to talk much at all. So I stopped asking, and just started to dip hands and toes in wherever I can. Eventually, I don’t know…

**Sondra:** Why do people say friends are forever? That’s so obviously not true.

**Mia:** Right?

**Dan:** Some of my hardest breakups were with friends.

**Mia:** I’m more surprised when a friendship lasts.

**Sondra:** Like when you move away after your friends buy a house, but then they follow you to Denver?

**Mia:** Yeah. I guess people change, and then you have a choice. Do you still want this? Do you want to come along for the ride? Or you change, and think: I want to bring these people along! What do I need to do, so they’ll come along? I mean, we’re not the same people we were, right? None of us are!

**Dan:** The same people who would drive half an hour to Applebees to get shitty wings and mudslides?

**Sondra:** Who were we?!

**Mia:** Who are we now? Why are we still here?!

**Dan:** You’re not the person I fell in love with!

**Mia:** That’s true!

**Sondra:** Yeah, that was me! But a different, younger me.

**Mia:** Like, I remember being a boy once. When we met, and even after we moved. I have those memories. But I also remember being a girl in those memories. The same memories, like there’s two of me, but together!

**Sondra:** It’s hard to be the same and also different.

**Mia:** But I think I would have liked ‘she’, even then…? So, I can give her that? Past tense pronouns?

**Dan:** Posthumous pronouns for past selves.

**Sondra:** I think I might start using they more. She or they. For myself. Now.

**Mia:** Oh? Fun! How does that feel?

**Sondra:** Uncomfortable. Like I’m making people think about it, and I don’t want people to think about it. Oh no, this really is my coming-out show!

**Mia:** Congratulations! _[To Dan]_ Are you sticking with he/him?

**Dan:** _[Pause]_ The more often people ask, the less confident I am about… having an answer. Or I guess I should say, the more often I repeat the answer, the dumber it feels. Masculinity felt dumb to begin with, and repeating it just feels dumber, like also, yeah, I’m right handed, but it doesn’t matter. I’m also a little left footed.

### [Song] ?Write the beginning / Exist In Between?

I believe I may need to exist in between
to stop here
live here
take up space here
in those spaces between buildings that aren’t one thing or another
those nooks in dead-end hallways
that don’t have a name
interstitial, interstices
(of minute animals) living in the spaces between individual sand grains in the soil or aquatic sediments
an intervening space, especially a very small one
intersistere - latin to stand between
situated within but not restricted to
occupying the holes within an atomic crystal lattice
the negative space spiders create
the holes they leave in their weavings
between pages
between sand grains
intervening in space
on this journey I call myself
I’ve arrived somewhere no one can quite name
including me
it’s a bit uncomfortable here at times
awkwardly shaped as it is
often forgotten
weedy
but even these places need someone to tend them
someone to point to them
to point out the unexpected beauty of
random maple tree sprouts and the trickling sound of rain through gutters, lost bits of silver gum wrappers and downy soft newborn bunnies
to those that happen by
I’m needed here
I fit
So, at least for now,
I’ll stay
in between

### [Story] Meet the argonaut

**Mia:** Look, I know it seems unlikely that there is mystical or magical water in Denver. But water is full of our greatest earthly mysteries. Like: what’s up with stale water? How does water go bad when you leave it out? It’s water.

**Dan:** I used to work at a food co-op and people would ask where we kept the organic water… like, do you even know what water is?

**Mia:** And the oceans have so much water. What are they hiding down there?

**Sondra:** Don’t they say that we know more about space than we do about the oceans?

**Mia:** Water is weird. Things that happen in water are strange.

**Dan:** Tell them about the argonaut.

**Mia:** _[a slide]_ The liquor store?

**Dan:** No, the other one.

**Mia:** _[more slides]_ Ok yeah. They’re a band of heroes in Greek mythology. Argo-auts, as in ‘Argo sailors’. Argo is the ship. They’re with Jason, before the Trojan war, searching for a golden fleece. But it’s been discontinued by Patagonia –

**Dan:** No, the octopus!

**Mia:** Oh, that makes more sense! Let me see… _[finding slides]_ Named after the myth, because these cephalopods spend their lives floating near the surface of the ocean! And we used to think they were using their tentacles as sails to move about. What?!

**Dan:** They weren’t.

**Mia:** Right. The females build these beautiful shells. The males, so so much smaller – a fraction of the size – don’t sidle up to the ladies to woo them. They stay their distance and detach a special arm – a special penis – you know, the kind full of sperm that they keep in a pouch under their left eye –

**Sondra:** Weird.

**Mia:** And they arrow it over to their giant lady love, who keeps it until she’s ready to use it.

**Sondra:** Puts it in her hope chest, as it were.

**Mia:** Or meet the deep sea anglerfish! You may know the anglerfish as being a pointy-tooth ancient-looking creature that is mostly mouth, with a glowing lure attached to its head? Well, the deep sea version is also covered in long basically fiber-optic cables.

**Dan:** High tech!

**Mia:** But only the ladies. The men are scrawny little guys that won’t fully develop without attaching themselves to a woman’s body, fusing them together.

**Sondra:** Blame the gods!

**Mia:** He becomes completely dependent on receiving nutrients from her and, in return, gives her sperm.

**Sondra:** What a fun trade.

**Mia:** Or meet the marine flatworm, famous for its penis fencing.

**Dan:** Everyone loves a little penis fencing.

**Mia:** Capable both of impregnating and becoming pregnant, when two of them meet, they battle it out with their two-pronged penises. Each trying to stab the other – because, of course – it’s a huge burden to be stabbed, and become a mother.

**Sondra:** Yeah it is.

**Mia:** It’s a dynamic fencing battle because no matter where one is pierced, they get inseminated. It’s sometimes called traumatic insemination, for obvious reasons.

**Dan:** Imagine how skillfully we would avoid each other if touch – anywhere – led to pregnancy. Hey, that’s like what your mom believes!

**Sondra:** Yeah, it is!

**Dan:** That would be lonely.

**Mia:** And I know you don’t really say ‘men’ and ‘women’ about animals. That’s not how this works. The words don’t mean anything in that context. Bigger gametes? It’s all just words. But you get it, right? We use words to gesture at a thing, the words aren’t the thing. Anyway: animals are weird, and we’re animals, and whatever.

### [Song] ?G C D with an A sometimes?

### [Story] No pussy in the mountains

**Mia:** Maybe there’s something to the Casa Bonita story.

**Sondra:** What do you mean?

**Mia:** Well, what if it isn’t the water specifically?

**Sondra:** Like the whole place is magic, or just the sopapillas?

**Mia:** Or there’s no magic at all, and the myth just has a water feature, for flair. So the myth is a spring that ‘makes men soft’ right? Maybe it’s just practical: mountain men, barbarians, coming down from the mountain, lured by the comforts of civilization – Casa Bonita, sopapillas, etc – and all the luxury makes them ‘soft’ in some way?

**Sondra:** Hardened cowboys, softened by the comforts of Casa Bonita? That could be a thing.

**Mia:** Like, I one night after rehearsal – this was years ago – I was hanging out on a porch near city park with some people I don’t really know. Not my porch, not my people – but we’re drinking, and this guy is telling me he used to live in the mountains. But then he says there’s no pussy in the mountains.

**Sondra:** What?!

**Mia:** Yeah, and then he looks at me, trying to figure me out, and says: I don’t know what you’re into, but if you like pussy, don’t live in the mountains. That’s why I moved to the city.

**Sondra:** What?!!

**Mia:** And maybe that’s the thing! Maybe Casa Bonita is a place people come, mountain guys who want to live in the city, and get a cat? Maybe they hang out at Casa Bonita. It’s this middle ground. City delights but in a rough mountain atmosphere? Or at least a dirty plastic facsimile? There’s a cave, and a mine shaft, a mariachi band, and cliff divers, a guy in a gorilla costume, and high school kids doing sketch comedy. It’s got everything! The total artwork! And then the kids, they’re doing a scene on top of the cliff, and they take their wigs off, and set their mics down… right before they accidentally get pushed into the water! They’re cliff divers, right, these kids? But it’s all scripted: a boy and a girl, pushed into the water. Do they become one? Is that in the script? Is it a euphemism? Are people getting laid?

And the mountain guys are getting drunk, and laughing, and they have another margarita, another sopapilla – those are the two things you get –

**Dan:** The two casa bonita genders –

**Mia:** And they have a great time! And they love it here, it’s so much easier than living in the mountains. But it softens them in some way, their tough exteriors. And they’re like: fuck, bro (that’s how they talk, maybe). Fuck, bro, are we losing our tough mountain exteriors? Are we getting soft?

**Sondra:** That’s how they talk?

**Mia:** There’s no pussy in the mountains, but then they come down here, and… I don’t know.

**Dan:** The real pussy was inside them all along?

**Mia:** I don’t know. Sure, maybe. Maybe they transition, and that’s a lovely ending for them. It could happen. I went to Casa Bonita, more than once. So… I don’t want to be like: I’ve solved it. I know why people become trans, it’s this mexican restaurant with mediocre food inside a pink castle in a strip mall in Lakewood. It’s not like we need a reason, but now we know, there it is.

## Part 3: Action and Reaction

### [Song] Whiskey 3

These are my own two hands, but sometimes I wake to find them still sleeping, and I shake them till they hurt.

We angle away from the dazzle of downtown lights, cross the highway on a footbridge, and watch the cars swirl south to Albuquerque or Tucson.

Herman skips ahead, while Sam and I hold hands in the back. The weather has been squalid all day — bright and muggy, then sudden, urgent spats of rain. The air smells of wet dirt, and Sam pulls me in for a momentary kiss before we continue towards home.

I wish simple childish things. Roller skates, foxes, and street lamps. I wish we dove in together and came up hours later. I wish I had more to say, and I wish I could say it. But there’s nothing inside me, and I watch my body disappear through the crowd, distracted by another woman.

Something she said… Sometimes you don’t know the secrets you carry but you can feel their weight in your body. And then you catch a glimpse of who you could be, in a thrift store on South Broadway, and the floor tilts, and the lights blur, and you’re falling. Flailing.

Every action carries reaction – equal, opposite, electric and violent. Something scrapes my knee and my breath escapes and the lightning touches gently down, and there’s static. Sam is dead. We find her– find Herman– there’s only static. I’m only—

I’m off balance all day. I run into things. I finish nothing I start. I put recycling in the trash. I use the last roll of toilet paper, and I don’t buy more. I ignore Herman’s phone calls. I break a plate. I eat cereal for dinner. I leave the water running, and I know that it’s running.

And I remember the wail of Herman's sudden solitude. We thought she was laughing. I went into the kitchen. She was holding onto the counter where she had collapsed, and the phone was dangling from its cord, and I'd never heard a sound like that — like the sound that Herman was making.

The essential condition for a kiss is that lips meet. There is no special technique required. And when I die, they’ll say she kissed us all she could. And I’ll say, through a video I recorded this morning, I’m sorry, still, that I didn’t kiss you more.

_[Pause. Sadness. They come together to toast to Sam/Herman. They are standing in the kiddie pool. They all drink from the same bottle. WTF. Something has happened. They return to the “wrong” instruments and begin to play. The pond monologue is songlike, performed by all three.]_

### [Magic Song] The pond speaks

Pond: Honestly, I wasn’t paying close attention at the time. My mind – if you can call it that – my mind was on other things. Plate tectonics. Continental drift. The movements of the lithosphere – crust and upper mantle. Plate boundaries that move apart, then come back together… And in that friction – the relationship between plates, the pressure and heat – there’s transformation. Rocks melt together, flow, and reform. Rivers spring up, join, diverge, and die again. Water sloshes, spills over. Glaciers slide through, evaporate, and disappear. Ponds and lakes form. Rain puddles, waterfalls, and kiddie pools. Here I am…

The truth is I don’t spend my time considering who comes or goes, or how soft they become.

Would you call me soft? Not soft like shower water almost slimy on skin. Or hard Denver water that leaves residue behind. But soft and hard like bodies. A water bed is soft, but a fire hose is not. A kiddie pool is…

We are all of us, here together, bodies of water. What’s that like? Are we soft, together? Our softness depends on the pressure, the force being applied. A relationship that ebbs and flows. We’re pushed, and we sometimes make room, sometimes push back. It’s the landing that is hard or soft, but our water remains… just water.

A pond or a spring, a lake or a puddle, a river, a person, a wishing well – words for water over time. Over and through what’s solid, eroding the rocks as we pass. That’s what life is, change. Movement. The need, maybe desire, lust for entropy. From order to chaos, through friction. Past into future, with no way to put it back how it was before.

Were they joined together in that moment? Or did they arrive already as one? Where does one human end, and another begin, over eons? There was a lot of splashing, that’s the main thing I remember. It seemed… not complicated, but stressful. A to-do. Water flowing through water, forming eddies and currents. What’s the plural of water? It’s still water. I’m still –

_[The music trails off. They are confused. Why are they in the wrong places playing these instruments?]_

### [Story] Make more toads

**Mia:** Strange. You can know all sorts of things with varying degrees of certainty, but you can’t explain every— you can’t explain–

**Sondra:** Do you want your bass back?

**Mia:** I–yeah–we should–um...

_[as they cross back to their original spots, they take great care to avoid walking in the kiddie pool. As they are moving:]_

**Mia:** Have I told you that I always jump in puddles too? At some point I figured that maybe the spring was so shallow, it dried up. So every time it rains I go out to see where the water has gathered, jumping in the puddles, looking for changes.

**Dan:** Like a toad in the desert.

**Mia:** Is that an insult? Or a compliment? I’m not sure.

**Sondra:** It’s just nature.

**Dan:** There’s a bunch of amphibians that go dormant in the heat.

**Sondra:** And they come out when it rains. To soak it up.

**Dan:** And mate. Gotta make more toads while you can.

**Mia:** I miss Sam.

**Sondra:** Yeah, and Herman.

**Mia:** Yeah. I miss how it was, sometimes. But also I don’t.

**Dan:** Do you ever dream about moving somewhere else?

**Mia:** Like do I dream dream, or do I have dreams? I guess neither. Sometimes I think – at some point I’ll probably move, so I wonder where – and that feels weird. But I don’t have anywhere I want to go right now… Why?

**Dan:** Well we were talking, and we’re just not, like, in love with Denver like we were before.

**Sondra:** There’s nothing wrong with it.

**Dan:** I know, but it’s not as exciting as it was. You can’t go to the city when you’re in the city. And I know at some point, with my parents… I’ll have to help out. Back east.

**Mia:** Oh. Right, sure. That makes sense.

**Dan:** But the band is in Denver. One of the reasons to be in Denver.

**Mia:** Oh, yeah. Yeah.

**Dan:** I want to keep doing this together. But not in a violent way.

## Part 4: Never Let Go

### [Song] Whiskey 4

so whether you like to go out to the theater, or to the opera, or would rather stay home. whether you like to be spanked or whipped – spanked or whipped, by an older person, or younger – by a person in costume, or what costume exactly, and what sort of whip — hard or soft, a wet towel or a bamboo cane, a riding crop made of peacock feathers, the eyelashes of a tibetan goat, hair from the head of a franciscan nun, a crowbar first and later a belt –

or in some special location. Church basement after mass, airport closet back-alley downtown train station. Or you count your lovers with both fists in them and names like primary, secondary, tertiary – one motherfucker, two motherfucker – till you need a bigger barn to hold them all. To hold them tight. You hold them tight, that's what I'm saying. You hold on tight, and never / let / go!

_[The end]_
