title: Strange Bird, Queer Bird
date: 2023-03-10
byline: >
  By Lars Reid and Grapefruit Lab (Julie Rada & Miriam Suzanne).
  Adapted from letters, journal entries, and text messages
  between Julie and Lars in the spring and summer of 2020.
---

The stage is a nest, surrounded by audience. **Lars** and **Julie** orbit the nest, outside and behind the audience. They speak through microphones, sometimes taking up more visible positions in an aisle, or using cell phones and hand-held projections – but never entering the space until the before scene.

Onstage: **Satin Bird** is black with blue highlights, maybe a dash of green or gold. **Flame Bird** is black with red highlights, maybe a dash or yellow or orange. **Satin** collects red objects. **Flame** collects blue objects. The collections are not gifts to share, they are building nests meant to impress. Between them, a set of swings. The birds never leave the stage. There’s a **band** at one end of the nest.

The text is built on various modes of communication: letters and journals, tinder bios, text messages, zoom calls, and songs. Each mode may has its own feel – using music, dance, lights, and projections to indicate changes. Generally, Lars and Julie take focus for texting and other digital communication, the birds take focus during letters, and both are present/active during in-person scenes and songs. While the focus is on Julie and Lars, the birds go about ‘daily routines’ – small and repetitive tasks in low light.

## Prelude

### The strange birds

#### [A Nature Documentary…]

_[In darkness. The sound of movement, wing-flapping, stomping. A voice…]_

**Sir David Attenborough Voice:**
The strange birds are rare. And give no fucks. They are lovers, partners, friends, comrades, at least for the sprinkler-summer interloping adventure. And maybe for this migration. Or the season, Or this life.

_[Small pools of light on the birds, alone in their home nests. We watch them as they go about their routines.]_

**Julie:**
Today is clouds and ash

I put more wood on…

At the end of the world will anyone care…

**Lars:**
Wouldn't it be good to know that

the world loved you, that I've never felt so alive,

Inside this stink, this slow decay,

the belly of the beast…

**Julie:**
A leap is different than falling, stumbling then tumbling. In a leap, you turn to your companion, look them in the eyes and say “On three”…

_[Lights fade.]_

## Currently Curious

### Tinder-hearted

#### [Tinder…]

_[Anticipation, excitement, newness. The world is open, light, low -stakes. The birds are comfortable and alone in their separate nests. Maybe hand-held projections are used to convey the digital nature of things?]_

**Lars:**
Tender-hearted queerdo, With a penchant for quick-wit, thick thighs, and sly grins.

**Julie:**
Fierce. Curious. Artist. Educator. She/her/they/them. Living an extremely busy full life of community and gratitude.

**Lars:**
Non-monogamous and a total heartslob.

**Julie:**
Currently curious about something monogamish.

**Lars:**
Looking for friends, queers to cuddle, and epic make-out sessions. I don’t love the saxophone. Or cops.

**Julie:**
Radical politics. Intersectional anarchafeminist abolitionist.

Hot for compassion, autonomy, curiosity, and engagement. I love to dance.

_[Some light on the birds. They demonstrate.]_

#### [Texting…]

**Lars:**
I love worn-out wool sweaters and Neil Diamond. I used to really love grey and rainy days and I still do if they're not also cold.

**Julie:**
I like grey days a lot. A lot. Like if I could swap out some bitterly cold sunny days for 2-3 days per month of grey and rainy, that would be fucking perfect. Sun and rain and nothing else.

**Lars:**
I like warm rain. The older I get, the colder I get.

**Julie:**
I like that you don't like being cold. Feels important.

**Lars:**
Yep. Pertinent information. I don't want to go skiing with you.

**Julie:**
Noted. Wanna meet up?

**Lars:**
Yep.

**Julie:**
Cool. Whatchya up to on Sunday?

**Lars:**
I’m free after three. What should we do? Coffee? Putt-putt? Flash tattoo? Walk around the lake?

**Julie:**
What if we did a combo? I've been in the mood for mini golf lately and I didn't even know it was a mood to have!

**Lars:**
Great! I’ll be the girl with the goatee. If there is more than one, I’ll be wearing a frilly scarf.

**Julie:**
I present as pretty femme, but I’m incognito genderfluid.

**Lars:**
Cool.

**Julie:**
Cool.

**Lars:**
See you then.

**Julie:**
Yeah, cool. See you then.

### A dance of introduction

#### [In Person…]

_[Lights up. There’s activity in the room. The band is tuning, informal. The birds are starting their days. A chirpingness to the world. Preparation, and preening from the dancing birds. Maybe some bird bath movements? Maybe there is foraging and nest-building. A brightly colored coffee cup lid? A napkin? A partially-eaten scone? Everything blue or red?]_

_[Music – fun, nervous, peppy. Connected, easy, flowing, and laughing. A dance of awkward meeting and courtship. Satin dancer arrives earlier, Flame dancer comes later. Satin ties themselves up in knots, but never takes their eyes off Flame. Flame flits. They take turns trying to impress one another. They are trying to be cool about it, but failing. They are embarrassed by an audience who knows them too well. The audience are trusted friends. They let the audience know it’s going well. Some scattered words from Julie and Lars, who pull up chairs to watch.]_

**Lars:**
So actually, and really this is the truth…

**Julie:**
Oh, tell me about that…

**Lars:**
Well, this is what happened…

**Julie:**
So that reminds me…

**Lars:**
Oh, did you have another…

**Julie:**
No, no, I canceled. They canceled, I’m…

_[The dance proceeds for a time. There’s a closeness. There should be a kiss, but instead…]_

## Plagueworld

### A power outage

_[Things fall apart — the music, voices, dancers. The power goes out, piece by piece. Everyone is isolated, or exits. The birds are alone. An uncomfortable stillness. Flame has become weak. Satin tends to their nest, but is easily spooked. Time is fucked up. There’s too much space. Does it start with a cough? Or end with a cough in the silence?]_

### A date with pearls

#### [Zoom…]

_[Does this involve projections? Is it partially pre-recorded?]_

**Julie:**
Hi.

**Lars:**
Julie Rada. You wore sequins.

**Julie:**
You wore pearls.

**Lars:**
And a vest.

**Julie:**
I couldn’t decide between sequins or suspenders.

**Lars:**
Why not both?

**Julie:**
Never both.

**Lars:**
Huh. I made a questionnaire. For our…/hang out

**Julie:**
/date?

**Lars:**
Would you… answer some questions I prepared?

**Julie:**
Of course.

**Lars:**
What are your thoughts on Meatloaf?

**Julie:**
…Um. I’m vegetarian. And gluten/-free so…

**Lars:**
_[overlapping]_ /the singer, not the food.

**Julie:**
Oh! Um…

_[a dance, low light — a give and take, a push and pull, curiosity that creates more curiosity. Lots of distance.]_

**Julie:**
Can I just… can you just pause… I want to get more comfortable? I didn’t realize we’d be…

**Lars:**
yeah… For so long, me either… Ready?

**Julie:**
Ready.

**Lars:**
Are you pigeon-toed?

**Julie:**
Nope.

**Lars:**
Ok. So another thing I was going to ask… Did you graduate High School?

**Julie:**
Yeah I graduated. Went to an arts high school which might've saved my life. My freshman year at a public school was Not Great. You?

**Lars:**
No. Not me. I flunked because I never went. I never went because they put me in a trailer for kids with developmental disabilities. At lunchtime they turned us loose into Gen Pop. The trailer was unkind. Lunchtime was sadistic.

**Julie:**
Texas. Ugh.

**Lars:**
The only thing I remember learning in school is the names of clouds.

**Julie:**
I think that knowledge is fucking aces. Cirrus, cumulus. That's all I got.

**Lars:**
Nimbus. Stratus.

**Julie:**
I think I know my columns though.

**Lars:**
Cumulostratus.

**Julie:**
Doric, Ionic, Corinthian…

_[Lights fade on the dance. Time passes.]_

#### [Texting…]

**Julie:**
Ok. So. I did some research. I had my wires crossed. Match Point was filmed in AZ, I believe, but had no relationship to 90210. It did, however, feature Renee O'Connor, who plays Gabrielle in Xena, so this feels notable. Jennie Garth definitely went to Apollo High School in Glendale, AZ, as her wikipedia notes. And I knew Meatloaf's daughter at Emerson College.

**Lars:**
This is all very good information. Thank you for following up just like you said you would.

**Julie:**
I am known for doing what I say I'm gonna do.

**Lars:**
Is that true?

**Julie:**
It might be.

### A time capsule

#### [Letters/Swapped…]

_[Maybe the letters are being folded into paper airplanes – blue and red – flying around the space. Each one folded, sent, intercepted, read, and stashed away. Each speaker voices the words sent by the other.]_

**Lars:**
Dear Lars, I have a proposal, if you'll accept it. That this become a shared document, a time capsule of our doomsday crushing. Julie.

**Julie:**
Dear Julie, Yes! I accept. A troubadour dream come true. Turns out it wasn't true that all I learned in school was how to call a cloud by name. I remember now, at my desk, learning how to address an envelope. (Sorry you missed out on my 13th century, drunk in the streets courtship routine). Signed, Lars. (With a heart?)

**Lars:**
Hello, Lars. I’ve pictured it on multiple occasions! You and your foppish wig, serenading me off key in the cobblestone streets. There's distance there, as well. Don’t forget, I'm still holding out for my 1990’s “Come to my Window” dyke drama, too. I bet we could make that one happen. Heart, Julie.

**Julie:**
Ok, Julie Rada. Here’s something that might be true about me: I might be from yesteryear. I was 25 when I sent my first email, my mom showed me how. In that first week, I probably sent 20 of them. I remember offering my mom cash for all the ink I was using to send all these emails.

**Julie/Lars:**
I remember how hard she laughed.

#### [Letters…]

_[A moment as they note the confusion, then decide to let Lars continue. From here, they each speak for themselves. Lars & Julie move out of sight.]_

**Lars:**
Julie, all that I have are black ink pens, and I was thinking that we should be able to tell on sight where we each end and the other begins. And so I stole this glittery pink pen from my housemates' scrap-booking supplies. I think you deserve it. I hope you like it. I hope I don't lose it. If I do lose it, I’m going to steal a different color. It’s not so much the color, it's the glitter that I think you deserve. Well, I'm not really sure what “deserve” means, but I think I want you to have words that sparkle, just in case they otherwise don't. Two hearts, Lars.

**Julie:**
Lars, I think a black pen is fine, but I welcome pink and glitter and a bit of theft.

#### [Texting…]

**Julie:**
We need to discuss writing.

**Lars:**
I wear a bathrobe when I do it.

**Julie:**
While I was cleaning, I happened to be listening to some Ani DiFranco, because I am definitely in a deep lez phase right now. I'm confounded that, as a word person, you don't swoon over her lyrics at least!

**Lars:**
Listen, I love Ani DiFrancos lyrics, they're brutal and clean, like open heart surgery. That voice though, it sounds like fluorescent lights. Also, I might not be a real lesbian.

**Julie:**
What about Tom Waits? His voice might be too incandescent for you, or LED, or something.

**Lars:**
I love Tom Waits' voice. It's like he drinks tar.

**Julie:**
How are things going in the quick wit, thick thighs, sly grins department?

**Lars:**
Are you still swiping?

**Julie:**
I haven't opened the app in a long time but I have a notification for a message. I haven't read it.

**Lars:**
You didn't read the message? Read it to me! Read me all of them.

**Julie:**
Here's one: “I'm free after 3. What should we do? Coffee? Putt-putt? Flash tattoo? Walk around the lake?

**Lars:**
No. Don't read mine. That's boring.

_[It becomes a dance-dialogue between the two birds for a while. Perhaps the birds do a little hunting and stealing of small objects for their collection, from the band, and maybe from places in the audience, hidden and discovered like easter eggs. Among these objects might be a fun pen or two, but maybe not. Eventually…]_

#### [Letters…]

**Lars:**
Here’s something else, I wrote that intro two weeks ago. I’ve been stuck here ever since. Everyday, for several days, I’ve put on the robe that reeks now of stress-sweat and so much cigarette smoke. I heard you wonder if you’ve ever inspired poetry, and I wanted so bad to show you that you had. Julie, I’ve spent 80+ hours on one good-enough poem that never happened.

This might be hard for you to believe because of my muscles and all, but Julie, I spook easily. All these words addressed to me… Terrifying! Not like spiders, I run from those. Terrifying like a churning sea or the throat of a volcano. The threat of being swallowed whole if I come too close. The temptation to come too close. I’ve been stuck here trying to do it just like you, because I wanted you to feel just like me: dizzied, breath-arrested, half-crazy.

**Julie:**
An addendum to the proposal, then. Not only will we reveal the scratches of our handwriting to one another, perhaps this can be a little document of radical grace for ourselves? Where the words don't need to be perfect? Language is a clumsy and blunt object at best. It attempts to name and make solid that which is unnameable and effervescent. So let's just give ourselves a break already, and honor the impulse to express ourselves to one another, the subtle and embedded ask to be seen?

**Lars:**
Hi, Julie. I'm going to do my very best to honor your request that we treat ourselves with radical grace in this document. That's going to be hard for me, because I'm hard on me. I'm hard on myself about words because they're not as good as they used to be.

You’re right, language is tricky. Often I feel trapped instead of freed by it. Couldn't we just red mark each other a little bit? Like, could you correct my comma usage? I'm certain it's all over the place. I put commas where I would pause if I were talking (seems like that's how they should work), writer's choice.

#### [Texting…]

**Lars:**
Have you ever seen the movie "Fur"? Have we talked about this already?

**Julie:**
Tell me about Fur.

**Lars:**
It's a good one. Fictional portrait of Diane Arbus, played by Nicole Kidman. There is a scene where she shaves the body of her lover with hirsutism, I've jerked off while crying to that scene 100 times.

**Julie:**
You keep making me laugh/smile and feel sad all at once.

_[Satin is spooked. Flame goes on the search. A kind of hide-and-seek.]_

**Julie:**
You say you spook easily. You worry about and seem to simultaneously want to be swallowed whole. I think I worry about the same. I think in the past I’ve filled the position of being spooked easily, inaccessible, aloof. I have quite the resume. I usually land the job. This time I’m experimenting with something else. I’ve taken an internship in vulnerability.

_[At some point, Satin has re-emerged, maybe preens and unruffles their feathers.]_

**Lars:**
I don't really want to die in a volcano. I just want to get close enough to feel like I'm really living. I don't really want to be swallowed whole by fire or by sea. Or by love. I just want to know in the bones of me, their bigness, their power, their chaos, their potential to transmute.

There is danger for me in some ways of love – has been – a faultline at the intersection of art and romance. A shakedown of the senses. Something chancy in the way artists love. I've lost my shape a time or two — frisking too high in the ether.

I'm not too scared, though. From what I’ve seen, you seem to strike a good balance between feral and function. I'm glad to hear that you've taken an internship in vulnerability. I'm interested in playing at that too. I'm vulnerable to certain kinds of joy, to certain kinds of heartache. I might cry in a room full of strangers when a piano sounds like the lowering of a child sized coffin

### A walk

#### [Texting…]

**Lars:**
Are you all the way distancing? What is your take on walking with a friend?

**Julie:**
I've been pretty hardcore. Why?

**Lars:**
Because I would walk if you would walk. Or sit if you would sit. I want to walk or sit. I want to see a person. I want to see you. With a mask and with an alluring amount of distance.

**Julie:**
Do you want to see a person? Or you want to see me? Those things are slightly different. _[pause] _I’m fishing.

**Lars:**
I know, and I said it already. I want to see you. Julie.

**Julie:**
Oh. You did. I wanted it again I guess. Phew. Let’s do that then! I'd like to see you too. When are we gonna engage in these high risk activities?

_[During this exchange, Satin puts shoes on.]_

**Lars:**
In 5 minutes or 5 days. Let me know when to put shoes on.

_[By now, Satin already has their shoes on. Looks down, smiles.]_

**Julie:**
Lars Reid: born ready.

#### [In Person, a song…]

_[Flame puts shoes on. They take a walk, with distance. Something liminal. Maybe Satin walks in place, in the center, simple, repeatable – while Flame dances extravagantly around Satin. Lars and Julie bring chairs to sit and watch. Music begins. Lars watches, while Julie continues…]_

**Julie:**
at summer camp they taught us to smell

ponderosa trees, ubiquitous, they smell like butterscotch

except the one, singular, that smells of chocolate

thirty years later

I still climb

ponderosas

prestige

performing, performing

The other day we walked and walked

I looked when you didn’t

strong hand scars

cradling

soft and prickly

a pinecone

somewhere west of 2nd and Knox

I know it

I noticed it

it meant nothing

I noticed it

it meant…

we wondered in trash oasis-dandelions-overgrowth

underfoot

I go slow

up slopes and sideroads

I speed on freeways

and I love grey space

but won’t play with the paces in between

and I said I’d carry the map

but I have no plan

for shady city ditches

I go somewhere in-between

I have no plan for crossed

armed book conversations and the philosophies of apologies

what’s healing what’s knowing

anything at all

I noticed right before we crossed

the street

you told me of the fire

the fire

that meant…

and I’d fight through grey space contagion

to grab you comfort you

I’d do it for anyone

I’d do it for you

two days ago I noticed

a trail of sweat

once home under breath

and tender soles from the grey

underfoot

in this plagueworld at moments I’m unmoored

what’s real what’s healing

dandelions grow, it means

what’s nothing

how to make sense of two bodies

caught in the slanted lateday light

interlocked and fighting

unreal

grey

_[At some point, Satin discovers a pinecone. Does it interrupt the song and dance, as they stash it away, and then return to their walking?]_

and if our recklessnesses don’t align

can we go somewhere in-between

But I noticed

like it was nothing

you picked up

the pinecone

lost track of when you lost it

but crossed arms and crossed streets and in the driveway

it was gone

today I lost my way

I had other plans

but stubborn as I am

I climbed anyway

trusting I knew the way trusting I had a plan

smelling trees as I climbed

dandelions here too

muscles aching and dizzy

but moored and searching

for magic in trees

for a trail of sweat

ponderosas

pinecones, ubiquitous

crunching underfoot

it means nothing

#### [Texting…]

_[At some point, Julie and Lars have left their chairs. The birds contend with them – stand on them, test them – take them back in their home nests. Both birds are changed. And maybe perched atop chairs.]_

**Lars:**
Are we dating (you and me)? I've been curious. Things are a lot different in a pandemic. Three days ago we had a "high risk" hangout. The risk was walking outdoors together, maybe too close. Six months ago I had a date and had to Google the dangers in drinking ejaculate/urine (the jury is still out in the scientific community). If what you and I are doing is dating. I'd like to keep doing it. I look forward to it.

**Julie:**
It's not dangerous to drink ejaculate/urine, pretty sure. I'd also like to keep doing what we are doing. My life is usually very busy (I think this is on my tinder profile so truth in advertising…

**Lars:**
Oh yes, I remember that.

**Julie:**
I'm usually working and rehearsals and prisons and driving. But not sure that shit will ever happen again so I'm thinking I might take up gardening or something.

**Lars:**
Do we really just talk until we get a vaccine? That could be the slowest burn!

**Julie:**
I know. My fucking karma for all the uhaul moments in my life. We will know all the things. Except I won't know what it's like to play with your hair. Maybe I could get a really long stick and use it in your hair?

**Lars:**
Maybe a rake?

### A heart with rattlesnake jaws

#### [Letters…]

_[Lars and Julie disappear. Flame has a solo – a dance of clinging, latching on, jaws that won’t shake off? Maybe some collecting.] _

**Julie:**
Hi, Lars. It's evening and it's hot and I'm drinking hot tea to perk up. See. I need energy. I stayed up last night later than I intended talking to you.

I notice how people treat (and talk about) others, past lovers, friends, family. You're pretty consistently kind. And it's a turn on. I think I move too quickly sometimes to do that hard work. Simply that my life or brain gets too full. You have time. And you don't squander your time.

_[The chairs get stacked. By Satin? By Flame? Both? The beginnings of some nest building.]_

I didn't let this tea steep long enough. And I'm mad because I'm rationing this tea out to myself. It's been discontinued. And when it's gone, it's gone. Ugh! I love it so much. I've had this box for a few years. I wrote to Yogi Tea and asked if they'll (please!) ever make it again. Nope. It's not on eBay or Amazon. I know. I'm thorough. I follow up.

Also, I like what I like. I attach and hold on. I wear my favorite socks until they're threadbare. I have a skirt from sixth grade still. I'm not sure I even like it that much. But we've made it this far. Rattlesnake jaws. I hold on.

Rattlesnakes are low to the ground and full of surprises. Like hearts, their jaws never give up. But do you think rattlesnakes ever get to feel what it's like to fall?

_[Now Satin has a solo – a dance of falling, flying. Swinging?]_

**Lars:**
Are rattlesnakes the only snakes with jaws like hearts that don’t let go? They might not know what it feels like to fall.

Are you familiar with the “paradise tree snake”? These snakes can glide through the air, they use undulation to propel themselves long distances. They appear to be flying, but the whole time they're actually falling. Maybe for those snakes, falling feels like flying. Did you ever jump out of swings when you were a kid? I did. Falling felt like flying then.

I'm a snake in the Chinese zodiac. I remember learning that as a kid from a Chinese restaurant paper placemat. “Snake: wise and intense with a tendency towards physical beauty.” and still, I like being told about myself.

#### [Texting…]

**Julie:**
Question: If there was some milk in the fridge and it had a date of May 8 (and it's May 17 now) would you: a) throw it away b) leave it in there and not drink it c) put it in your tea.

**Lars:**
I'd have someone else sniff or taste it.

**Julie:**
And if it checks out?

**Lars:**
Throw it away.

_[...]_

When you drive, do you brake fast? What if after all of this talking we have the worst first kiss? Last night on the phone you called me a deflector. It might not be true, I’m just not great at answering on the spot. Moving forward, please submit all questions in writing.

**Julie:**
I brake slow and easy. I hate fast braking. And I use my turn signals.


**Lars: **

I'm enjoying more than cute flirtation.

**Julie:**
To clarify: We are flirting. You are cute. Maybe the flirtation is cute, but, for me, cute doesn’t modify the flirtation. I'll be straight up. I think I'm having a crush! On you! THERE. It's been said.

**Lars:**
I don't know about the first kiss. Maybe we'll be wearing masks.

**Julie:**
Maybe we could kiss through a dental dam! We could also reconfigure our germpods. I think your germpod is shady.

**Lars:**
I think I have a crush on you too! Do you think this "deep lez" phase that you’re in is being influenced by your new crush? Or vice versa? Either way, these playlists we’ve made for each other are supes gay!

**Julie:**
Nope. Sorry. I think after being busy for so long I just have time to be gay again. Also how perfect is “come to my window” right now, for covid lez crushes. You think your current crush is making you Extra Gay?

**Lars:**
Oh, way! It’s duck lips in the mirror all day over here.

#### [Letters…]

I think about that walk. That playground wrapped up like a crime scene. Virus. I held a pinecone instead of your hand. Quiet. I noticed you notice, and it felt like closeness. Crossing streets, I tried to step in time with you from six feet apart, and when I could hold it, it felt like intimacy, unstolen. Not like kissing. Not like fucking. Maybe something like rowing a small boat in the same direction. It felt like connection, which felt like rebellion, which always feels good and important. I like the tension, Julie. This electricity we’re making without any friction. Let’s stay creative. Let’s keep connecting.

## Clouds & Ash

### A world on fire

#### [Song…]

_[Music. A rip in the sky, something jarring. Flame is having a tantrum. Maybe they line up their collection and destroy it? Body slam it? Scatter it? Maybe ash is falling? Maybe there’s a haze? Satin is contemplative. Maybe sitting in the swing? This back-and-forth can be adjusted to work with the band…]_

**Julie:**
Today is clouds and ash

I put more wood on

how much can it take, you got

this I got

this taste on my tongue of ash

and salt-skin-scratched, curls singed

angry under a storybook sky all cumulous and wisps and my spit

tastes like rage the world

tastes like dying

and I’ll tend to the ashes and in the meantime I’m

sweaty and setting

fires and wondering if neighbors think I’m

trash goes on too, I make no distinction

at the end of the world will anyone care about

bloodstreams thick with gas and ash I’m spitting

off signals, clouds to the edges

and even in my big bed I clutch in attendance

I grew up in Phoenix I know how this works

_[Music shifts, low and tame for Lars sections, back up for Julie.]_

**Lars:**
From my place in this grass, I think about your rage. Your revolution. Your fires. I wonder if your rage will rub off on me, like sad-slutty liquid eyeliner that I love so much! I could use some angry tears, but not too much, just enough to get shit done. Your rage is righteous. Brave. Changes things.

**Julie:**
(second attempt, she’s outta practice)

this day of clouds and ash and

in the gap between

(altocumulous turned cirrus)

she heaves things

(nevermind the scratched skin)

(nevermind the singed curls)

she heaves what until yesterday lived native unplanted plants

(it’s all in the naming

containing)

(the weeds turned smoke)

**Lars:**
I think about your revolution too. What it looks like. What’s on the other side? I fantasize sometimes about trees climbing through the windows of the U.S Mint. Years ago, in a note to her youngest kid, a great love of mine said this: “build a boat, son. A flood is coming.” It’s haunted me since. I wonder now if that flood is here.

**Julie:**
she learned in survival class not how to survive but

how to place the tourniquet between the poison and her

heart she learned

how vegetation sends up white smoke a

message, a plea

in the dark night (she’d rather burn tires on this day of ash and clouds under storybook sky and wisps that care not about deaths in the thousands and delayed kisses but enough black smoke)

and with burning eyes

salty tongue

(rage, guilt)

**Lars:**
I don’t hold much hope for revolution but I sure like to sing along with the songs. I hope I’m wrong. If I am, let us be comrades. I’ll scour the grasses for money to burn.

**Julie:**
she might forget the indifference that

kisses are antiquated and

touch is science fiction

she tears at her hair

sets fires makes

messes and

waits

loading up the pit with trash

with life

with certainty

with hope

(altocumulus turned cumulous)

**Lars:**
You grab an ax and trim the fence lines. Feed the flames. On the other side of contagion, corruption, capitalism, can you take a break without having to fall first? Take a nap without endoscopy? Will there be “forgiving floors” for dancing?

**Julie:**
This day of clouds and ash

This day of scorched earth

and anticipation

This dirt under nails and

general filth

she sends up missives

they say

“I grew up in desert, I prefer it”

They mean nothing.

**Lars:**
Your fires burn higher than mine. I like that about you. I’m a lot of water, a lot of the time. Have you ever seen an image of deep-sea lava? Molten rock, burning hot, dancing blue-orange under the weight of an entire fucking ocean?

**Julie:**
She knows, she knows

I know

The thing about desert is it’s always trying

to kill you

But by passivity and seduction stay

vigilant, stay

hydrated

The thing about desert is

oases are for believers

and wildflowers for

seekers and on this day with annihilation

under tongue and

under nails she know she got

out

I know I got out

I know I

got this

**Lars:**
And hey, Julie, on the other side, can we try that sometime? I think it’s possible that some of your ash is laying in this grass beside me? That’s a fun thing to think about.

**Julie:**
And that is enough, enough

Because these sun and clouds, there’s

fire and ash

There’s beginning, middle, end and

time that heaps up on itself

and she heaves it

all to see what she can

Take

_[Flame breathes heavily, taxed. Satin in reverie.]_

### A date with fire

#### [Texting…]

_[The world darkens. Lars appears…]_

**Lars:**
What is your take on sitting 6 ft apart beside a fire pit?

_[Julie arrives…]_

**Julie:**
If it's at your house will there be a fire in the pit or just a fire pit?

**Lars:**
Just a fire pit with a sacred heart Jesus candle from dollar tree in it. I can provide hand sanitizer and snacks. Come lay in the grass.

**Julie:**
You make hand sanitizer out of everclear? I used to make purple passion out of it.

**Lars:**
I used to just make a fun and sloppy mess out of it.

**Julie:**
Oh it seems warm enough this evening. Do you have firewood? I can bring some.

**Lars:**
I have firewood.

#### [In Person, a song…]

_[At some point, the birds have collected more chairs – sometimes from the band. Satin prepares to host. Maybe they drag in a chair as an offering that Flame uses to test their balance on? Satin and Flame circle each other. They make sure to stay six feet apart. Lars and Julie bring chairs, to sit and watch.]_

**Julie:**
Those close to me don’t trust my reverence for danger

I have it I hide it

There is a line missing here something true

about me

naked and direct – not clever at all

and I’m doing clutter clean-up and scribbling love poems on the sly

even in the wasteland of need – I crave forbidden

sprinkling duplicity into

the open space of permission

**Lars:**
No telling when I’ll miss you most

or how  and from where

here

you’ve always been half ghost

half bones—half cloud

the very best of

underfoot sounds

**Julie:**
you don’t get the market on messes

and so what if the love songs I love sound like they’re

falling down stairs, shoved

or volitional

the results are the same – I save

crooning & silk for

break-ups and pulses for

lovemaking

but punches through verses sound like lust just the same

**Lars:**
I worry about your bones

The marrow

What happens to what’s being carried there

Where will your loved ones’ stories go?

here

**Julie:**
I’ve lose all my lines

when I’m at a loss

I’m setting fires to the backyard

but only in the space where the green doesn’t grow

in the green I crouch low

whisper words of encouragement

life

life

it’s possible

it’s fucked and it’s

possible

my faith

**Lars:**
I’ll miss your skin

looking at it

But not too close

laid bare for scarring

Forgiving of sin

your skin did most of the listening

music with your eyes closed

Where will you go now?

a vanishing point

where the train track ends

**Julie:**
I have it I hide it

those close to me watch suspicious

of the hazards with whom I dance

but I always lead

tumbling love poems love songs into the backyard

green space of possible

it’s fucked and it’s possible

lots of sparks

hit the dust

burnout

but even those can sound like

the possible to me

**Lars:**
I hope you’re a horizon line

where firmament meets farmland

If you haunt me

I hope it’s your hands

the punctuation between your lips

Always ellipsis

I hope it’s your books

and the wet woods scent of you

_[Lars stands, leaving the chair open to be taken by the birds. Then Julie. They wander back to their world outside the nest.]_

#### [Texting…]

**Julie:**
My hair smells like campfire and in related getting-to-know-each-other info: I don't bathe daily.

**Lars:**
My track suit smells like campfire, and I shower every other day.

**Julie:**
I think US Americans are obsessed with bathing and grooming in ways that are kinda silly.

**Lars:**
Once in a while I silly-groom. Masks, foot things etc.

**Julie:**
I almost never silly-groom. I just paint the entire end of my toe, and wait for the paint to chip off the skin. Do you exercise in your tracksuit?

**Lars:**
These days I do most things in it. It’s my uniform for end-times.

## Getting Attached

### Girls called sir

#### [Letters…]

**Julie:**
Last night, I glimpsed your thigh in a bed that wasn't yours, and the other day my eyes lingered on your hip in your new jeans. I have no earthly idea what you were saying. I really like sensory details. That is what gives the world meaning.

**Lars:**
Peak sensory experiences: In industrial kitchens dry goods are stored in giant bins called lexans. A sensory delight I may never know again is my hands submerged in 12 gallons of sesame seeds. Also, the sound of trains, the screechy wheels, the click-clack tracks, the whistle, the brakes, they all hit me in different places in different ways. Together, they take me out of myself and away. A train will make me cry in the best of ways. I'd like to take a train trip with you. Your head on my shoulder, mine in the clouds.

_[Flame in their own world, Satin in theirs. Two stories living in parallel.]_

**Julie:**
When I was 18, I had what I thought was my first girlfriend for about two weeks. She worked the graveyard shift at the Denny's. I watched the sunrise from the booth of the smoking section so many times, Lars. We studied paradoxes and I did a project on the time arrow.

**Lars:**
Peak sensory experience. Watching waves Julie, I could do it all day. The swell, the crest, the break, the retreat. A wave is magic that science will explain by way of the moon, and then all you’ve got is double the woo, because the moon is fucking magic too! Oh, and snow falling under street lamps. Fog at the foot of a mountain. Bird murmurations!!! Baby Boomers dancing to Rock n’ Roll, peak!! That funny chittering thing cats do when they’re stalking a fly. The cold side of a pillow. The paper soft feel of old people skin. You in that purple dress, carrying the shyest bouquet of the wildest flowers. Crunching on Sonic ice.

**Julie:**
There was a moment, sitting at the table at Denny's and Sara standing above with the carafe of coffee, that solidified something in my sexuality forever. Here was this sexy, gender-strange woman, who went about Glendale, Arizona, hiding the shape of her body — conscious or not, it doesn't matter — in large and boxy clothes designed for men.

**Lars:**
On a walk once with a lover, we passed by a large house with a large privacy fence with tiny peaches hanging over. She grabbed some, I felt sorry for her, finding such delight in the smallest of fruits from the tallest of houses.

**Julie:**
Well, she absentmindedly scratched her belly, pushing up the fabric of her Denny’s uniform, and I got to see — glimpsed — the curve of her belly, and hip curves like a secret. Something pleasing and hidden and maybe even hated by her. But God damn.

**Lars:**
Later, at her place on a twin mattress in the corner of a dark and cluttered basement, she brought one of those peaches to my lips. Fuck Julie, it was everything!! Each peach, two bites of perfect. We got drunk on them. Smashed them into eachothers mouths, onto each others chests, bellies, thighs, cunts.

**Julie:**
And it's been that way ever since. I got more of these stories. Girls called “Sir” who've allowed me to glimpse their curves. I'm patient. In this way. I lie in wait. I've got time. These days for revelation.

#### [Texting…]

**Julie:**
Minus the world. How's your day?

**Lars:**
Okay so far (minus the world). I just made a playlist of all my favorite teenaged albums.

**Julie:**
Yeah. Why is nostalgia so alluring right now? Is it like eating comfort foods?

**Lars:**
If comfort foods were tacks, yes. End days maybe. I’m all up in Nine Inch Nails right now.

**Julie:**
I stole my mom's Pretty Hate Machine tape in 6th grade.

**Lars:**
I stole my mom's Doral ultra lights in 6th grade.

**Julie:**
I think our moms would like each other! I saw Nine Inch Nails in concert. It was very clarifying to realize that dudes were much more interesting to me in fishnets and eyeliner.

### A birthday card farewell

#### [Letters…]

**Julie:**
I made you this list.


1.
As you know, I love stone fruits. I like freestone because it's efficient and easy. The flesh falls off and you get it all. But I've been reconsidering because clingstone is rare and almost always sweeter. Which do you prefer?

2.
Bindweed has a large and hardy root system, rhizomes sucking up dust, minerals – resources. And above ground it twines and blooms like tiny morning glories. It clings like crazy. Do you think it's a weed?

3.
If the Dog Days start on July 3rd, what astral event do we call the short time between Solstice and your birthday? They're named after Sirius the Dog Star but it's actually two stars that appear interconnected. Have you ever noticed?
This is a birthday card. Happy 43rd.

_[Does Satin start packing a red suitcase?]_

I’d be lying if I pretended I wasn’t worried about that bend in the road, just a few weeks away. You’ll be gone as though we needed to put on the brakes and slow for tight curves. As though twists and bends weren’t already this thing we’re doing.

**Lars:**
From the word “stop” you can form four other four letter words, that’s a lot for such a small word. That's what I do in cars. A little game I made up when I was 10 on the drive home from the state mental hospital where I would visit my mom once a week for a handful of months. That ride was rough and long, my dad forbade me to cry, It’s hard to hold a sob at the back of your throat for 90 miles, and so, I made up games to play.

### Apart together on the road

_[Time passes, apart…]_

#### [Letters…]

**Julie:**
Interstate I-80, post-hike mid-iced-coffee-perfect-road-trip conditions right before the canyon walls. Right before I’d learn you were riding while I was driving the same stretch of perfect road trip highway.

**Lars:**
Here's some things I saw on my ride today: 47 empty train cars. I like the looks of those. They were yellow like yarrow with fast landscape moving through them. I saw 2 turkey vultures on a post. Every time I see scavenger birds, I think it's a sign that I'm almost dead. I saw 1 stand-alone chimney at the foot of a Red Mountain. Folks sat around that once. I like to think about them.

**Julie:**
I’ve been listening to music I either know you love, or music with lyrics that invoke impressions of you. Well. There was some farmland, watered by those metal circular water contraptions that look like Tinker Toys. And among the sprinklers in this field of crops were too large and awkward birds, gangly legs and strange beaks. I was speeding. Eyes off the road just a moment to glimpse them. A mirage. Not herons, not egrets. Three to four feet tall and freaky looking. I didn't have reference for these weirdos on this cloudless summer late morning in the West.

**Lars:**
I saw 8 cows on top of a mountain. What were they doing up there? I think that I saw the book cliffs you told me about. I didn't point them out. I wanted them for me. I like to share most things most of the time. Today, I just wanted something mine. Do you think that's okay? I did share my Ritz Bits.

**Julie:**
I knew in an instant two things:


1.
The strange birds were rare. And gave no fucks.

2.
They were lovers, partners, friends, comrades, at least for the sprinkler summer interloping adventure. And maybe for this migration. Or the season. Or this life.
And I wanted to tell you all about them. So here I am sharing with you this non-secret secret about these delightful queerdo birds. I swear I'm not spinning metaphors.

**Lars:**
I heard in a news clip about how Japan banned screaming on roller coasters. “From the mouth is how the virus spreads…”

It's early here. 5am. In a few days I’m heading home.

**Julie:**
I assume you're on your morning rituals right now. And I mostly am over here too. But I'm here thinking on you nonetheless.

**Lars:**
Inside my sister's piecemeal trailer, I sleep in a tent to keep the critters away. Opossums live under a crack in the floor, they come in for cat food. Inside, my sister keeps the curtains drawn. Inside, there are 8 houseplants, none are living, haven’t been for years. On a window ledge there is a dead lizard, much more shriveled than on my last visit. In the yard there are 6 mattresses, all too pissed on to sleep in. Two more than on my last visit. I think if they opened the curtains, things might change. Did you know I’m afraid of the dark?

I wonder what you're doing right now. I wonder if you've had a chance to write anything down.

**Julie:**
My world and pace is much slower than usual so I can really delve, really indulge my senses. This is a gift. I don't often get to share all my little everyday noticings with anyone who cares or understands. They're just tiny, private experiences. That's cool sometimes. Other times it's lonely.

**Lars:**
In six days when I’m back, if neither of us is contaminated we are going away together. How are you feeling about that? When I think about being with you (in that way) I feel both relaxed and anxious. Brackish. I get nervous that we won't fit in those ways.

If our mouths come back, safe to spit, Julie—would you call me bitch? And if our hands return from the wash, fit for re-filthing, and if you aren’t listening, Julie—could I call you baby? I think that I can wrap my arms around you twice. Post plague, will we call each other liars? Will we call ourselves crazy? Will we call each other home? Either way, we don’t say. This ain’t the time for naming things.

**Julie:**
As I was thinking about these words, I took a walk. And I kept thinking of one question…

### Questions about toppability

#### [Texting…]

**Julie:**
Would you ever want to be called “Daddy”?

**Lars:**
It's a fun game to think about playing, the names we might call each other. _[Pause]_ Julie.

**Julie:**
Lars, Always Ready with Strong Hands and Words of Encouragement. Yes?

**Lars:**
I want to wrestle you.

**Julie:**
I want to lose.

**Lars:**
You will.

**Julie:**
I'll make you work for it though.

**Lars:**
I know.

**Julie:**
I wanted to review topping/bottoming since I felt like I perhaps misled and made myself seem exclusively bottom-y. In getting to know you, I've evolved an interest in potentially topping you, cuz that also seems like it could be funsies. So I was testing to see how receptive you might be.

**Lars:**
I'm sure it would be funsies. I would totally top me.

**Julie:**
You’re toppable.

**Lars:**
I have some questions about this statement: "you're toppable". I’ll submit them later.

**Julie:**
Send questions about toppability when you're ready.

**Lars:**
I don't know, Julie, if I'm more of a top or a bottom, I might be more like a fitted sheet in that way.

**Julie:**
I want watermelon. Cool, refreshing and sweet. I haven't had enough this summer. I want you, smart, soft and refreshing. I haven't had enough this summer.

Let's get watermelon for Palmer Lake. You cut it up with your strong hands and knife skills. And I'll eat it. Naked.

### Anticipation, preparation

#### [Texting…]

**Lars:**
Hi, Julie Rada!

This is some gay crush shit

all about you, ‘cuz babe,

the world is dying, and when it's done,

wouldn't it be good to know that

the world loved you, that I've never felt so alive,

Inside this stink, this slow decay,

the belly of the beast,

“you're the good things.”

Girlboy ballerinas skipped through my sleep hypnosis last night. It was sweet.

**Julie:**
Hi, that sounds nice. I think you're an interesting human.

**Lars:**
Oh.

**Julie:**
Negative?

_[It takes a moment to understand the question, then it clicks.]_

**Lars:**
Affirmative. Negative. You?

**Julie:**
All is positive, and by that I mean negative. So yeah, I’m so fucking ready. You ready?

**Lars:**
“Lars Reid: Born ready.”

_[Traveling… a short trip.]_

## A Temporary Nest

### Taking refuge

#### [In Person…]

_[Julie and Lars sit on chairs dangerously close to each other. A dance of touch, carrying, bearing/sharing weight, swinging, picnicking, rolling, building, play.]_

**Lars:**
Historically, I set word traps for humans I find interesting. Something here says to send invitations instead, but I'm not well versed in those.

I'm trying to say that I like you and I'd rather invite you to like me than to lure you. Which is new. Phew! God.

**Julie:**
You don't scare me

**Lars:**
I don’t?

**Julie:**
Naw. Not scary. Sorry

**Lars:**
Okay.

**Julie:**
Do you wanna be scary?

**Lars:**
No.

**Julie:**
Oh. Ok. Good. Yeah not scary. But I am also extremely brave so I can't really tell if that's about you or about me.

Amendment: Kinda brave.

_[This time Julie struggles]_

Do you think you've got corners where I can reside? I don't mind shadows or cobwebs. In a dispossessed wasteland, do you think we can take refuge together? Play orphan birds and build nests? What dangerous thoughts can you share?

**Lars:**
So much time It seems I've lived in cluttered corners, in shadows, self imposed. I'm working real hard on cleaning out those cobwebs. There isn't room for you there. And I'm glad about that.

#### [In Person, a song…]

**Julie:**
we are animals

growing up in drought

I didn’t know my body

waxed and waned with the seasons

like the moon

between moon cycles

I dry up and I soak

droughts and monsoons

cucumbers and brownies

strawberries and soups

sandwiched between the boxes of each year

**Lars:**
Aren’t we already taking refuge? I'm doing that with you. In tiny boxes. In large swaths of grass. Between these lines and under new moons.

**Julie:**
we are animals

costuming comfort

sheltering in place

amassing materials

nests of drywall chicken wire plastic

it’s spun glass

it cuts

it cuts my fist

I lift each foot lightly

quicksand asphalt

I cut my figure down the center of streets

all fortification and abandonment

my ideology jagged and out of alignment

we are animals

**Lars:**
I've often sought asylum in lovers, libidinous lairs for licking wounds. This isn't that.

**Julie: **

–and only some of us fit–

**Lars:**
A fire, an ocean, tree shade, a wide-open star-filled sky. And yes, a nest. A Julie shaped home in my heart.

**Julie:**
I'm thinking about these troubled times, these genuinely disturbing times we live in. And how we might experiment in splashing around in the comfort of one another. Maybe. If I find what it is, can I share it with you?

**Lars:**
Are those dangerous thoughts? Your talk of rattlesnakes makes me less afraid of them. I've had dangerous thoughts of meeting your mom. Of making you sacked lunches with notes inside.

## Back to Reality

### Boomerang, an extraction

_[The birds extract from one another. The world goes limp and lifeless again, similar to the plague shut-down earlier, but not quite that extreme. Just a cold, grey world. Birds are separated. Lars and Julie are separated too.]_

### All fucked up

#### [Song…]

_[Maybe there are leaps and falls.]_

**Lars:**
Last week this time, we had just left our make-believe home in Palmer Lake. New peak sensory experiences: The morning sun on us, that mountain breeze, the twitch of your upper lip when you braved the first “I think I’m falling in love with you.” Six mornings we spent together, taking turns bringing each other coffee, pulling cards, telling stories, never mentioning that everyday we spent playing house was bringing us closer to the distance waiting at home.

**Julie:**
I am all fucked up and

I am all fucked up

**Lars:**
Peak sensory experience: singing Metallica at the top of our lungs on the drive back to our separate germ pods. It was good there. It ain’t around here. Rising cases. Fascist dictatorships. They’re disappearing people from protests. Wildfires!! So much smoke in the air. Clouds and Ash.

**Julie:**
I am gnashing teeth and

I am breaking bottles and

the workday hasn’t started and

I am calling therapy and

I am cradling your hair and

I am writing letters loud and

I am killing buddhas and

I am dying on this hill and

I am steering clear of eyes and

I am pulling weeds innocuous

I am pouring coffee in the hole inside my belly and

I am filling up on prayer while

knowing it don’t matter and

I am craving medicine and

I can hardly breathe at all and

my cunt is sore and broken from longdesired lust and

I am turned toward healing and

I am running up this street and

the lyrics to this song keep singing

  I am all fucked up

  I am all fucked up

and

**Lars:**
I feel intoxicated when I feel connected. Today I just feel hungover.

Last week I understood us, like we shared bones. At Palmer Lake, you had a believable look about you, believable like the moon. When we came home, I bought gluten-free granola and started looking for a loop-hole. But now we’re back in this old new place and the silver slivers of daydream are being eclipsed by this immeasurable bleak.

We walked last night. It was different from other walks. More distant, but it ended in the usual way: not kissing goodbye in my driveaway. Now that I’ve touched your face, I fucking miss you!

**Julie:**
and

I am whole and holy and so are you and so is he and

I’d give my last dollar to anyone in need and

so would all of us, I know

and I am barely navigating

I am sifting slowly and

I am sorting seeds of worth from husks that need discarding and

I can feel my ribs held up in your heavy hands and

I can hear the screaming of wild geese in fleeing and

I am settling in quicksand

I am grasping for the wheel and

and

I am diving into streams of big and bloody hearts and

nothing here is certain and

patience ain’t a virtue and

I could draw a circle ‘round my mind and

I could run away but

it’s 8AM in summer and

I am smashing bottles and

I am raging healthy and

I am fucking lost and

I am in the center and

I am holding steady and

I am holding steady

**Lars:**
I haven't had a phone for several days now. And so, I’ve been without answers. Haven’t been able to google up: Why are there so many dead fish at Sloans Lake right now? Who sings What’s New Pussycat? I’m uncomfortable in this space we’re taking, even though I asked for it.

I had a dream last night that my dog died. I was crying and preparing her body for burial. When I went to take off her collar it was a rusted Ouroboros. I removed its tail from its mouth. I pulled the moon card again this morning. Can you believe that? I can’t believe you don’t love Nicole Kidman. She always looks like she’s on the brink of coming or a blink away from crying. Do they teach that face in Theatre school? I thought she played Virgina Woolf beautifully. I really tried to read Virginia Woolf. Kind of boring.

News from the lake: They took the floating fish bodies out and replaced them with ones that wriggle. Weird!

_[This is a goodbye, something resigned and final.]_

Falling in love has been a beautiful distraction from this wide-awake nightmare that we’re, so far, still living in. Who falls in love during end-days?

_[Lars maybe leaves a note on a chair. Julie retrieves and reads.]_

## One kind of landing

### A leap of faith

#### [In Person…]

_[Lars and Julie are visible, but not texting. The birds begin to merge their collections and build a single nest in the center. Maybe they take breaks to swing together, for the first time.]_

**Julie:**
You wrote me a private note saying, “leap of faith.”

**Lars:**
Why is it called falling in love? Is the implication a loss of footing?

**Julie:**
A leap is different than falling, stumbling then tumbling. In a leap, you turn to your companion, look them in the eyes and say “On three.”

**Lars:**
A while back, you asked me a question on a card that was waiting for me when I came “home” from my trip. Something like, what does home feel or look like to me?

**Julie:**
Landing a leap is all about soft knees. These days I'm curious about landings.

**Lars:**
Home for me has never been about place and more about feeling. I’ve felt at home as much on a Greyhound bus as I have in my own apartments.

**Julie:**
“It's going to be a rough landing,” the pilot says, and the passengers brace themselves and everyone survives just fine. A bit jostled and out of breath, wide eyes connecting with strangers. “We did it, we’re okay.” Everyone having gone through something.

**Lars:**
We got evicted a lot when I was a kid. We often left in the middle of the night, leaving behind everything we’d collected since our last move, including friends. I’m not very attached to people, places or things.

**Julie:**
The flight attendants, all business, tug their sweater vests down, smooth their hair, put away the jump seat, and prepare for everyone to disembark. That's one kind of landing.

**Lars:**
So we moved around a lot growing up and I’ve kept with that movement for all of adulthood. I added it up once and I think it was close to 50 places that I’ve lived. 3 years is the longest I’ve stayed put and that was recently.

**Julie:**
I've been thinking about comfort. Not physical comfort really, though, sure, that too. But I've been thinking about comfort, the verb. As something done between people as an expression of care.

**Lars:**
I’ve always lived under the threat of eviction. I don’t know the feeling of having truly unpacked. I have one red suitcase that I carry around, it holds every thing that ever mattered to me. Your letters will go in it when I’m no longer reading them every 5 minutes. It’ll be a while yet.

**Julie:**
I wonder about how you feel about being comforted. I've detected resistance, I guess. And I get it. Dude, I know it. I think comfort as action came at a cost in my childhood. If you were comforted, then you owed something.

**Lars:**
Sometimes I’ve gotta take stuff out of the suitcase to make room for new stuff. It’s never easy. I’m attached to memories and sensory details.

**Julie:**
Self-comfort might be safer. Best to not be needy. But as we grow closer, fall into each other, I wonder how comfort can be an action of love, not rescue. Reassurance.

**Lars:**
“As long as I can see the light”, do you know that one? It’s a Credence Clearwater Revival song that I know and like. Did you know that my fake-real dad only listens to CCR? This song makes me think of some kind of home. The kind you can leave and come back to. So many times I’ve chosen the color of the walls that would close me in.

**Julie:**
You can't do a trust-fall alone. It's nearly impossible to fall without catching yourself with your hands. That's the trick to a trust fall, overriding the impulse to catch yourself and instead to let yourself be caught. And oof, it ain't easy. It stretches the limits of discipline. And you simply can't do it alone.

**Lars:**
I sometimes fantasize about home as a structure, like what if I win the lottery shit. Sometimes it's a New England Colonial style, a ferry ride to Provincetown. Sometimes it's a craftsman, with an abundance of built-ins, walking distance to good coffee. Sometimes it's a giant dilapidated farmhouse with a crooked porch, a missing step and so many open windows. Once in a while I make a home out of an old school-bus, an atrium with a bed in it. Or a silo, or an old train car.

_[Maybe somewhere in here, Julie and Lars take to the swings, entering the space for the first time? Maybe the birds have shed their bird-like costumes, and take up space together in their nest-for-two?]_

**Julie:**
Coyotes and badgers hunt together. One digs well. The other is fast. You collapse under the weight of paper and I hollow out my insides to fill up with tasks and productivity. This past week, we've had to be a bit vulnerable to share these things. Maybe we can be a badger and a coyote though?

**Lars:**
I wish I had something that my mom could get old in, something I knew we wouldn’t have to move from. I thought I might have that by now, but alas, I never learned how.

**Julie:**
My mom complains of a family vacation to Death Valley when she was a kid. But I love the brutal sun, the terrible heat, the threat of exhaustion, exposure, veins turned to dust from dehydration. I can dig up the barren earth, badger-like and get daffodil bulbs in the ground on one of these unseasonably hot days here at the end of the world.

**Lars:**
I think it’s possible though, home. I’d like to cultivate something like that inside my own heart. This heart that mostly knows what home isn’t.

**Julie:**
An act of hope, a leap of faith, a promise of renewal and future. Maybe you can get us food like a coyote, hunting with strong, soft hands.

**Lars:**
I feel at home when I have the luxury of good natural lighting.

**Julie:**
Landings look for softness. Bed of feathers, a spring wood floor for dancing, strong hands to catch a body. Hands reaching out on instinct to catch oneself.

**Lars:**
Lately my fantasies of home are laid with “forgiving floors” and I’m watching you dance.

**Julie:**
On three? One… Two…

_[A song and dance of taking flight as lights go out. Or Lars and Julie swing and seem to prepare to jump out of the swings as lights go out. Or they kiss? Does the band play “As long as I can see the light” by CCR, as a curtain call?]_
